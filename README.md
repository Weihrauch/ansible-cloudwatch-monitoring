Cloudwatch monitoring
=========

This role is intended to automaticaly install and configure the AWS script to report memory and disk usage to cloudwatch console.
 
Script usage and documentation can be found on AWS doc : [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/mon-scripts.html)

The script is started through a wrapper which set AWS_EC2CW_META_DATA to /var/run/aws-mon. This variable is used by AWS script to cache fetched instance-id. As /var/run is cleared on startup you won't have an invalid instance-id if you launch EC2 instances from AMI cooked with this role.
